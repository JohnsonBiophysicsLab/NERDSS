To build NERDSS requires:

1. c++ compiler
   For Mac, these are provided with XCode.
2. Gnu Scientific Library installed (gsl  version 1.0 or higher)
   this can be downloaded from here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/
3. To compile using make:
    1. Move to the main directory NERDSS
    2. Type 'make serial' or 'make cluster' (cluster version uses the cluster check in sweep_2D routine for dense 2D system to avoid overlap)
    3. Executable will be placed in the directory NERDSS/bin
