							<h1>About</h1>
							<h2>What is NERDSS?</h2>
							<div class="col-12"><span class="image left"><img src="images/about_1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
							<p> <b>NERDSS</b> was developed to build self-assembly into the reaction-diffusion (RD) model because of the strength of RD in 
								simulating relatively slow, nonequilibrium dynamics. The name of the software may sound somewhat redundant (particularly NERD).
								 The “nonequilibrium” is included in the name to emphasize how self-assembly can be simulated here in generalized, 
								 nonequilibrium systems such as the cell. Additionally, although the RD model is commonly applied to studying systems 
								 not at thermodynamic equilibrium, it is nonetheless useful for quantifying the pathways to and composition of equilibrium 
								 for complex multicomponent systems. The standard computational approach for studying self-assembly, using 
								 coarse-grained molecular modeling, provides access to these pathways and equilibria with more physically detailed 
								 models, in which interactions emerge because of distance-dependent energy functions rather than the rate-controlled 
								 events of RD models. A coarse molecular model thus naturally can accommodate a range of structures or defects 
								 and capture emergent cooperativity, strain, and localization of components. However, they are still relatively 
								 limited in the length and timescales of dynamics they can access, which does not extend to the cell scale. They are 
								 parameterized by potential energy functions, and converting these to the binding free energies or rate constants for comparison 
								 to experiment is nontrivial. Lastly, chemical reactions require covalent bond breaking that is not typically accessible in 
								 molecular modeling, preventing systematic and transferable methods for involving enzymatic or ATP-driven reactions 
								 ubiquitous in cells. These models are unable to simulate in vivo cell signaling, cytoskeletal dynamics, or clathrin-mediated 
								 endocytosis, for example. Our NERDSS software addresses this substantial application gap, and although it lacks the detail of 
								 energy-function based models, it is able to uniquely preserve important features of molecular assembly.</p>
							<h2 id = "ioNERDSS">What is ioNERDSS?</h2>
							<p> ioNERDSS is a python package developed by our group to assist NERDSS simulations. Its functions include generating NERDSS input 
								files from a graphic user interface and user-friendly models, and analyzing NERDSS output files.
							</p>
							<h2>Who are we?</h2>
							<p> NERDSS was developed by the Johnson lab at the Thomas C. Jenkins Department of Biophysics at the Johns Hopkins University. 
								Our multidisciplinary research group studies dynamical systems in biology. We address how macromolecular self-assembly is 
								controlled to occur at the right place and time, with focus on endocytosis, viral exit, and transcriptional regulation. 
								Group members are interested both in principles and design of self-assembly, as well as biological function in cells. They 
								develop and apply theory, modeling, and simulations to these problems, with frequent collaboration with experimentalists.</p>
