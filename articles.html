							<br>Jiang, Anmin, et al. Nature Communications 15.1 (2024)</p>
							<p>Endocytosis requires a coordinated framework of molecular interactions that ultimately lead to the fission of nascent 
								endocytic structures. How cytosolic proteins such as dynamin concentrate at discrete sites that are sparsely distributed 
								across the plasma membrane remains poorly understood. NERDSS is used to model the 3D to 2D binding of dynamin to the cell membrane

							<br>Husar, Adam, et al. PLOS Computational Biology 20.4 (2024)</p>
							<p>The authors describe and validate a new version of the open-source MCell simulation program (MCell4), which supports generalized 3D

								surfaces representing membranes, and combinations thereof. For volume-surface and surface-surface reactions, MCell subdivides 
								the surface areas of geometric objects into small tiles with a maximum of one molecule can occupy one tile at a time. Simulations that involve
							    binding to a surface are performed with MCell4 and with NERDSS, MCell3, and VCell. Their results show good alignment and the algorithm 
								that MCell4 incorporates is validated.</p>

							<br>Guo, Sikao, et al. elife 12 (2023)</p>
							<p>For HIV virions to become infectious, the immature lattice of Gag polyproteins attached to the virion membrane must be cleaved. 
								Cleavage cannot initiate without the protease formed by the homo-dimerization of domains linked to Gag. However, The mechanism 
								of Gag-Pol dimerization is unknown. The authors use NERDSS to carry out simulations of the immature Gag lattice as derived from 
								experimental structures, showing that dynamics of the lattice on the membrane is unavoidable due to the missing 1/3 of the spherical 
								protein coat. These dynamics allow for Gag-Pol molecules carrying the protease domains to detach and reattach at new places within 
								the lattice.</p>

							<br>Qian, Yian, et al. Biophysical Journal 122.15 (2023)</p>
							<p>For retroviruses like HIV to proliferate, they must form virions shaped by the self-assembly of Gag polyproteins into a rigid lattice. 
								The energetic criterion for forming stable lattices is unknown, as are their 
								corresponding rates. Here, the authors use NERDSS simulations with models designed from the cryo-ET structure of the immature Gag lattice to map 
								a phase diagram of assembly outcomes controlled by experimentally constrained rates and free energies over experimentally relevant 
								timescales. It is shown that multiple Gag lattices nucleate before growth can complete, resulting in loss of free monomers 
								and frequent kinetic trapping. Based on the simulations, the authors propose a mechanism by which Gag binding to IP6 can provide 
								the additional time delay necessary to support smooth growth of the immature lattice with relatively fast assembly kinetics and 
								avoid most kinetic traps.</p>

							<br>Guo, Sikao, et al. Biophysical Journal 121.3 (2022)</p>
							<p>Clathrin-coated structures must assemble on cell membranes to internalize receptors. These structures can grow surprisingly large, 
								containing over 20 clathrin seemingly locked in a hexagonal lattice, yet often fail to form productive vesicles. The authors 
								combine in vitro kinetic measurements and NERDSS simulations to build a theory to differentiate mechanisms of stable vs 
								unstable clathrin assembly on membranes. Their model predicts how adaptor protein density controls stabilization of clathrin-coated structures 
								against spontaneous disassembly, and shows ATPases are not required for lattice remodeling, which is a critical advance towards 
								predicting productive vesicle formation.</p>

							<br>Mishra, Bhavya, et al. J. Chem. Phys. 154, 194101 (2021)</p>
							<p>Protein assembly is often studied in a three-dimensional solution, but a significant fraction of binding events involve 
								proteins that can reversibly bind and diffuse along a two-dimensional surface. The authors find that proteins can
								accelerate dimer formation due to an increase in relative concentration after change in dimensionality, driving more frequent 
								collisions, which often win out over slowdowns due to diffusion. With validations from NERDSS simulations, they derive a single 
								expression for the characteristic timescale of the 3D to 2D assembly process, where the change in dimensionality renders rates 
								and concentrations effectively time-dependent.</p>

							<br>Johnson, Margaret. E., et al. Molecular Biology of the CellVol. 32, No. 2 (2021)</p>
							<p>The authors defined a series of computational test cases ranging from very simple to moderately complex, varying key 
								features of dimensionality, reaction type, reaction speed, crowding, and cell size. A number of commonly used computational programs
								or approaches including NERDSS were tested on these test cases. The strengths and limitations of these programs and approaches for exploring 
								cell biological questions were discussed to provide a framework for decision making by researchers developing new models.</p>

							<br>Johnson, Margaret E. & Hummer, Gerhard, Phys. Rev. X 4, 031037 (2014).</p>
							<p>This paper introduces the free-propagator reweighting algorithm (FPR) for particle-based RD. We combine the use of the 
								exact Green's function for a pair of reacting particles with the approximate free-diffusion propagator for position updates 
								to particles. Trajectory reweighting in the FPR method is able to recover the exact association rates 
								for a pair of interacting particles at all times. </p>

							<p><b><a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4929390" target="_blank">Theory of bi-molecular association dynamics in 2D for accurate model and experimental parameterization of binding rates</a></b>
							<br> Yogurtcu, Osman N. & Johnson, Margaret E., J. Chem. Phys. 143, 084117 (2015)</p>
							<p>The dynamics of association between diffusing and reacting molecular species are routinely quantified using simple rate-equation 
								kinetics that assume both well-mixed concentrations of species and a single rate constant for parameterizing the binding rate. 
								In two-dimensions (2D), however, even when systems are well-mixed, the assumption of a single characteristic rate constant 
								for describing association is not generally accurate, due to the properties of diffusional searching in dimensions d ≤ 2. 
								When FPR is extended to 2D, diffusion impacts more strongly the reaction kinetics in these 2D systems.</p>

							<br>Johnson, Margaret E., J Phys Chem B. 122, 11771 (2018)</p>
							<p>We develop a relatively simple but accurate approach for building rigid structure and rotation into single-particle 
								reaction-diffusion methods, providing a rate-based method for studying protein self-assembly. This approach reproduces 
								both the kinetics of association, which is altered by rotational diffusion, and the equilibrium 
								of reversible association, which is not. The macroscopic kinetics of association can also be predicted on the basis of the 
								microscopic parameters of our structurally resolved model, allowing for critical comparisons with theory and other rate-based simulations.

							<p>This paper introduces an algorithm for reversible binding of proteins to continuum surfaces with implicit lipids, providing
								 dramatic speed-ups to many body simulations. This algorithm implements FPR 3D-to-2D to account for the 
								 reactive flux at a surface and handle diffusion on surfaces that have arbitrary topologies.</p>
