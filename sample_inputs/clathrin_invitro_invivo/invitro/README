distinct labeled self interactions multiplied by 2.

Clathrin is a flat trimer, it has a clathrin leg length of 6nm, so two bound clathrin have COM separated by 17nm (including 5nm binding radius).

In this model, the Clath + AP2_on_mem/IL is 25uM. koff=0.03s-1 (kon and koff of Clath + AP2_on_mem/IL can be adjusted; keep Clath + AP2_on_mem/IL 25uM)
Clath + Clath is 120uM. koff=10s-1. (kon and koff of Clath + Clath can be adjusted; keep Clath + Clath 120uM)

Increase Clath + Clath if either molecule is bound to an AP2_on_mem/IL, by a factor of 11. (the factor can be adjusted)

Use loopCoopFactor=0.001.

Add reflecting site at clathrin COM to prevent passing through each other.

length3Dto2D is 30nm for all binding reactions. (This parameter can be adjusted)

the volume/area ratio = 991nm and clathrin concentration in the solution is 80 nM, which is maintained through addition and destruction reactions.
