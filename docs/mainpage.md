\section quick Quickstart

\subsection Dependencies

- C++ compiler, one of the following
  - GCC >= 4.9.0 
  - Intel >= 16.0
  - Clang >= 3.3
- GSL >= 1.5
- CMake >= 3.0
- Make >= 4.2.1

\subsection build Building NERDSS

1. Create a build directory and move into it: `mkdir build; cd build`
2. Create the Makefile using CMake: `cmake ..`
3. Make the executable: `make`
  - Use the `-j $NUMCORES` flag for faster building, if you wish, where `$NUMCORES` is the number of cores your CPU has (probably 2 or 4).
4. The executable is now in the build directory, entitled `vector_rd_reweight_NOPBC`

\subsection run Running NERDSS

- See \ref input for information on input file syntax and format.
- All molecule files (mol files) must be in the same directory as the binary (need to change this)
- The parameters file can be in any directory, as long as you pass the path to the binary as a command line argument.
- To run, simply type `./$BINARY -f $PARAMFILE`, where \$BINARY is the path to the binary and \$PARAMFILE is the path to the parameter file.

- Can use several command line flags to modify at runtime:

  | Flag | Description|
  |------|------------|
  | `-f <filename>`, `--parmfile <filename>`    | declares the parameter file (required)                                    |
  | `--seed`                                    | manually declare a seed for RNG (optional)                                |
  | `--debug-force-dissoc`                      | force dissociation to occur whenever possible (optional, for debug only)  |
  | `--debug-force-assoc`                       | force association to occur whenever possible (optional, for debug only)   |
  | `-r <filename>`, -`--restart <filename>`    | declares the restart file (optional)                                      |

\subsection restr Restarting a Simulation

- With each write of the restart file, the current state of the RNG will also be written as a binary file (called rng_state)
- To restart a simulation, make sure the trajectory, RNG state file, and restart file are in the same directory, then run `./$EXE -r $RESTART`, where `$EXE` is the executable and $RESTART is the restart file (called restart.dat by default)
- As of right now, some limitations
  - The restart will fail if the trajectory and rng_state files are not in the directory.
  - The restart blindly appends to the trajectory, i.e. it does not yet check to make sure the last written iteration matches the restart file.

\subsection examples Examples

Example simulations can be found in \ref examplesPage.

\section help Troubleshooting

\subsection genDebug General Debugging

- To do general debugging (e.g. with GDB/LLDB), cmake with the following command: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, in order to activate the debug flags.
  - `-g`: generate debugging tables for GDB/LLDB
  - `-fsanitize=address`: Uses a sanitizer to give information about memory access issues, such as out-of-range element access
  - `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`: stores the stack frame pointers for functions (needed for `-fsanitize`)

\subsection buildHelp Build Errors

### Issue: FindGSL.cmake is not in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH

- CMake can have trouble finding GSL on machines on which it is installed in non-standard directories (e.g. supercomputers/clusters using `module` environments)
- Solution: Set the `GSL_ROOT_DIR` environment path to the root directory containing GSL.
  - For example, on MARCC type `export GSL_ROOT_DIR=/software/apps/gsl/2.5`

### Issue: Make has no recipe for all

- Full error: 

      make[1]: *** No rule to make target '/some/path'.  Stop.
      Makefile:83: recipe for target 'all' failed
      make: *** [all] Error 2

- Solution: Explicitly state the target executable: `make $EXEC`, where `$EXEC` is `nerdss` or `vector_rd_reweight_NOPBC` (depending on the version)
